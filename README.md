# Personal Portfolio

Hi, I’m Khushi 👋 

This is my personal portfolio where I share what I enjoy building and learning as a developer.

1. Primarily focused on frontend development - React, TypeScript, clean UI, smooth interactions

2. Comfortable working with backend basics (Node.js, Express, APIs) to bring ideas end-to-end

3. Design-aware developer - I care about layout, spacing, and why something looks the way it does

4. I like understanding things deeply, not just making them “work”

5. Constantly learning, experimenting, and improving with every project

This portfolio is a snapshot of my growth as a developer; more coming, always. 🚀
